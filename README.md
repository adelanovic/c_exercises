Learning C/Exercises

I am using this to store exercises that i do while learning to program in C. 
The code that i upload here will be heavily commented on for my own purpose.
The intention of this is to learn and hold myself accountable.

Perhaps this will also help other beginners learn C programming.

I welcome any input on how to improve and simplify anything on here. 

Thank you
Del
